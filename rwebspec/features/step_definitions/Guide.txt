Steps
-----

1. operations need to start with @browser. For example, the below won't work
  
  click_link("New Application")
  
  But these are:
  
  @browser.click_link("New Application")
  @browser.link(:text, "New Application").click

2. Use @browser.text.should contain("text) instead page_text.should include("XXX)
 
   As page_text is a helper method for RSpec.

3. Can't use try, you may replace with repeat_try. For example, change this

  try(3) { @browser.text.should contain("No office has been selected") }
  
  to
  
  repeat_try(3) { @browser.text.should contain("No office has been selected") }
